# Best Practices

Practical patterns for teams running Agentgrader in day-to-day development and CI. These recommendations come from real benchmark workflows: fast feedback loops, reproducible scoring, and predictable cost.

## Start with `agr init`

Use the built-in scaffold instead of hand-writing every file:

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install -g agentgrader
agr init my-benchmark
cd my-benchmark
```

```bash [bun]
bun add -g agentgrader
agr init my-benchmark
cd my-benchmark
```

:::

Set your API key, then run the bundled hello-world task:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
agr run tasks/hello-world/agr.yaml --config agent.yaml --verbose
```

Once that passes, replace the fixture and prompt with your own task. Keep the same folder layout (`tasks/<name>/agr.yaml` + `fixture/`).

## Project layout

A layout that scales well for teams:

```
my-benchmark/
  bench.yaml                 # optional manifest for agr bench --manifest
  agent.yaml                 # default agent for quick agr run
  agents-configs/            # one YAML per architecture you want to compare
    claude-sonnet.yaml
    gpt-mini.yaml
  test-cases/
    fix-greeting/
      agr.yaml
      fixture/
  .env                       # local only, never commit API keys
  .agr/db.sqlite             # run history (gitignore this)
```

Version-control test cases and agent configs. Ignore `.agr/` and `.env` in git.

## Validate before you benchmark

Agent runs are slow and cost money. Catch YAML mistakes first:

```bash
agr validate test-cases/fix-greeting/agr.yaml
agr validate test-cases/fix-greeting/agr.yaml --strict
```

`--strict` fails when SWE-bench fields (`test_command`, `fail_to_pass`, `pass_to_pass`) are missing. Use it in CI before any `agr bench` step.

## Fill in regression fields deliberately

For SWE-bench style scoring, `agr validate` does **not** auto-populate `fail_to_pass` or `pass_to_pass`. You must run the test suite once, read TAP output, and copy test names into `agr.yaml`:

1. Run `test_command` inside the fixture (locally or in Docker).
2. Note which tests fail on the broken fixture (`fail_to_pass`).
3. Note which tests must stay green (`pass_to_pass`).
4. Re-run `agr validate --strict` to confirm execution checks pass.

See [Test Case YAML](/reference/test-case-yaml) for the full schema.

## Set budget guardrails in YAML

Add `assert:` criteria so a run fails when an agent spirals:

```yaml
success:
  - run: npm test
    expect: { exit_code: 0 }
  - assert: steps <= 15
  - assert: cost_usd <= 0.10
timeout_seconds: 300
```

Tune limits per task difficulty. Tight limits catch runaway tool loops early.

## Choose the right bench mode

| Goal | Command |
|---|---|
| One task, one agent | `agr run tasks/foo/agr.yaml --config agent.yaml` |
| Full suite × several agents | `agr bench --suite test-cases/ --configs-dir agents-configs/` |
| Hyperparameter sweep (model × temperature) | `agr bench --matrix matrix.yaml --suite test-cases/` |
| Reproducible team config in one file | `agr bench --manifest bench.yaml` |

Use [Bench Manifest YAML](/reference/bench-manifest-yaml) when you want suite paths and agent globs checked into one file. Use `--matrix` when you need a cartesian product of dimensions, not hand-written agent files.

## Compare adapters fairly

When benchmarking an external ACP agent (Claude Code, Cursor Agent) against the built-in AI SDK loop, pass both adapters explicitly:

```bash
agr bench \
  --suite test-cases/ \
  --configs agent.yaml,agents-configs/agent-acp-claude.yaml \
  --adapters ai-sdk,acp
```

See [ACP Agent Adapter](/advanced/acp-agent) for config fields and tool routing.

## Debug failed runs

Every run gets a UUID stored in `.agr/db.sqlite`:

```bash
agr trace <runId>
agr trace <runId> --quality
```

Use `--verbose` during `agr run` to watch tool calls live. Check `metrics["static-quality"]` and `metrics["llm-judge"]` for non-blocking quality signals that do not affect pass/fail.

To reset history, delete `.agr/db.sqlite`. Test case folders on disk are never modified; only the sandbox copy inside Docker changes.

### Measuring toolkit adoption

`agr trace <runId> --tools` and the `agr bench` `TOOL USAGE BY CONFIG`
footer break down `executeCommand` (AI SDK adapter) and `terminal/create`
(ACP adapter) calls by the *first word of the command*, e.g.
`executeCommand:find-usages` or `terminal/create:pytest`, instead of one
opaque `executeCommand`/`terminal/create` total. This makes it possible to
see, at a glance, whether a custom `toolkits` CLI tool (vs. generic shell
exploration like `find`/`grep`/`cd`) is actually being used, and to compare
adoption across a `--matrix` of `toolkits` dimensions.

With `provider: anthropic`/`openai`, each toolkit skill is also registered
as a first-class tool named `tool_<name_with_underscores>` (e.g.
`tool_rename_symbol` for `rename-symbol`), separate from
`executeCommand`/`terminal/create`. `agr trace --tools` shows these calls
under their own `tool_<name>` row, and `require_tools_before_submit`/
`track_tools` recognize them as usages of `<name-with-hyphens>` alongside
the `executeCommand:<name>` form, so a model is credited for adoption no
matter which mechanism it picks.

If you know up front which toolkit commands an agent *should* use, set
[`require_tools_before_submit`](/reference/agent-config-yaml#require-tools-before-submit)
in `agent.yaml` (e.g. `["run-tests", "inspect-code"]`). Every run then
annotates `metrics["tool-adoption"]` with which of those commands were
actually invoked before `submit`, surfaced by `agr trace --quality` and a
`TOOL ADOPTION BY CONFIG` footer in `agr bench`. This never blocks the run;
it just turns "is the agent actually using the tools I gave it" from a manual
trace-reading exercise into a structured, comparable signal.

A `MISSING` result is a *diagnostic* signal, not something prompt wording
reliably fixes. On easy tasks, a model that is confident its first attempt is
correct may skip verification entirely (no test command of any kind, not even
a generic `pytest`) rather than switch to the toolkit's `run-tests`, and
stronger wording ("you MUST...", "X is the ONLY way to...") can make adoption
*worse* by competing for attention on a task the model already considers
trivial. Treat persistent `MISSING` results as a cue to look at task
difficulty and the model's own confidence, not just at your system prompt.

If one toolkit tool internally calls another (e.g. a `rename-symbol` that
runs `run-tests` on the affected files after renaming, instead of leaving
verification to the agent), the wrapped tool still counts as "used" for
`require_tools_before_submit`, as long as it prints a self-identifying
`<name>: ...` line to its output (the way `run-tests` prints
`run-tests: running <files>`). Without that marker line, a wrapped call is
invisible to the adoption check, since the agent never invoked the wrapped
command itself.

For optional toolkit tools that aren't ready (or aren't meant) to be
required, set [`track_tools`](/reference/agent-config-yaml#track-tools)
instead. It uses the same detection as `require_tools_before_submit`, but
only annotates `metrics["tool-usage"]` with a used/unused breakdown - it
never affects `metrics["tool-adoption"]` or pass/fail. This is useful for
watching a newly added tool's adoption rate across many runs before deciding
whether it earns a spot in `require_tools_before_submit`.

### Scaffolding new toolkit tools

Run `agr toolkit-add <name> [--dir <toolkitDir>]` to generate a `bin/<name>`
script stub and matching `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` stub in the layout
described in [ACP Agent Adapter](/advanced/acp-agent). Fill in the
implementation and description, then reference `<toolkitDir>` from
`toolkits:` in an agent config or test case - no more hand-copying an
existing tool's pair of files and editing every reference.

### Design new toolkit tools as part of an existing workflow step

When adding a new optional `toolkits` tool, slot it into a workflow step the
agent is *already* following alongside a tool it already adopts, rather than
introducing it as its own standalone step (and especially rather than adding
it straight to `require_tools_before_submit`). A tool grouped with an
already-adopted tool for the same step (e.g. "before submit, run `lint-tool`
and `new-tool` on every changed file") tends to get picked up immediately,
even unrequired - whereas a standalone new step competes for the agent's
attention the same way stronger prompt wording does (see above).

**Caveat: don't draw conclusions from a single run.** Tool adoption on small,
synthetic tasks (e.g. one-file leetcode-style fixtures) varies a lot
run-to-run independent of toolkit design - the same agent config can adopt
every "before submit" tool on one task and skip all of them, including ones
it previously adopted, on another equally trivial task. A single A/B run
cannot reliably attribute an adoption change to a prompt or toolkit tweak;
either average over several runs, or use a task where the model isn't
confident enough to skip verification outright.

**Caveat: a redundant tool can stay unused even on a perfect-fit task.** If a
new tool's purpose overlaps with an existing, already-adopted tool's (e.g. a
"can I safely delete X?" tool vs. a general "find all references to X" tool
that can answer the same question), the agent may default to the familiar
tool even on a task designed specifically to need the new one - not because
the new tool failed to register, but because the existing tool already
satisfies the immediate question. This is distinct from the
overconfidence-driven MISSING above: the agent *did* verify before acting, it
just used tool A where you expected tool B. Before adding a tool that
overlaps with an existing one, consider whether it should instead be an
additional mode/flag on the existing tool (the existing tool then surfaces
both answers in one call) rather than a separate command competing for the
same moment in the workflow.

**Confirmed fix: fold the redundant tool's output into the adopted tool's
output.** A "can I delete X?" tool (`safe-delete`) and a "where is X used?"
tool (`find-usages`) were tested side by side on two different fixtures - a
single-file zero-usage case and a multi-file case with several call sites
per symbol. Both runs adopted only `find-usages` (3/3 calls including the
to-be-deleted symbol) and never called `safe-delete` (0/3), independent of
usage-pattern complexity or prompt ordering. Rather than removing the
redundant tool outright, its check was merged directly into the adopted
tool's output: `find-usages` now appends a one-line "no usages outside its
own definition - likely safe to delete" verdict whenever a symbol's only
match is its own declaration. A follow-up regression run confirmed the
agent still adopted `find-usages`, still removed the dead function, and did
not short-circuit on the new verdict line. This gets the redundant tool's
information to the agent for free, on the call it was already going to make,
without adding a competing step to the workflow.

**The redundancy generalizes across task shapes, not just renames.** On a
task whose entire prompt was "remove this dead function and its now-unused
import, then run the tests" (a textbook fit for `safe-delete` and
`optimize-imports --fix`), the agent again called only `find-usages` to
confirm the function had no callers before deleting it by hand, and never
touched `safe-delete`, `optimize-imports`, or `inspect-code`. Combined with
the two fixtures above (both renames), this is now three different task
shapes where a generic "explore/verify" tool the agent already trusts
(`find-usages`, or a plain `pytest`) fully substitutes for a purpose-built
toolkit tool. Introducing a lint issue alongside the main change does not by
itself push adoption toward `inspect-code`/`optimize-imports`: once the
agent's own verification step says "safe", it has no remaining reason to run
a second, unrequested check.

**`agr trace --quality` now shows *how* each required/tracked tool was
adopted, not just whether it was.** The fold-in pattern above (e.g.
`inspect-code` findings folded into `show-diff`'s output) flips
`tool-adoption` from MISSING to OK without the agent ever calling the
wrapped tool directly. That distinction used to be invisible: OK looked the
same whether the agent called the tool itself or only received its output
secondhand. `metrics["tool-adoption"]` and `metrics["tool-usage"]` now record
a per-tool `usedVia: "direct" | "wrapped"`, and `agr trace --quality` prints
one line per required/tracked tool: `run-tests: OK (called directly)` vs.
`inspect-code: OK (via another tool's output)` vs. `MISSING`. Runs recorded
before this change still print `OK (mechanism not recorded for this run)`
rather than a misleading MISSING. This makes the *mechanism* of adoption
part of the trace output itself, so a fold-in's effect is visible on every
future run, not just the one where it was first measured by hand.

**`bucketToolName` now looks past a leading `cd <dir> &&`/`cd <dir>;`
prefix.** A re-run of the dead-code-removal task above showed the
fold-in's effect on `inspect-code` (now credited via `show-diff`, closing
half of a previously-MISSING `tool-adoption`), but `run-tests` was still
MISSING even though the agent *had* run the tests, via `executeCommand
{"command":"cd /app && python -m pytest test_mathutils.py test_consumer.py
-v"}`. The bucketing took "the first word of the command" literally, so this
collapsed to `executeCommand:cd` - hiding the real command (`python`) behind
the directory change every agent makes before running anything. `cd`-prefix
stripping (including chained `cd a && cd b && ...`) now makes
`executeCommand:python`/`terminal/create:pytest`-style buckets visible
regardless of whether the agent `cd`'d first. This doesn't change
`run-tests`'s MISSING verdict here (raw `pytest` still isn't the toolkit's
`run-tests` wrapper - that's a real, separate adoption gap), but it makes
`track_tools` entries for plain commands (e.g. `pytest`, `git`) accurate
even behind a `cd`, which previously undercounted them.

**A "surgical edit" tool can stay unused regardless of file size, if
`readFile`/`writeFile` already cover the same edit.** A tool that adds a
single line to a file (e.g. an "Auto Import" quick-fix that inserts a
missing `import` statement) was tested on a one-file task whose target grew
from ~7 lines to ~70 lines across iterations, specifically to check whether
a bigger file would make the full-file `readFile`+`writeFile` round trip
expensive enough that the agent would prefer the targeted tool instead.
Adoption stayed at 0 at both sizes: the agent read the whole file, wrote the
whole file back with the import and the rest of its edit included, and never
reached for the dedicated tool - the larger file mostly showed up as extra
cost (more ad-hoc verification steps), not a change in editing strategy. If
a toolkit tool's value proposition is "fewer tokens for the same edit" rather
than "an edit the agent couldn't otherwise make", don't expect file size
alone to drive adoption; either fold its check into a tool from a step the
agent already takes (see above), require it via
`require_tools_before_submit`, or accept it as a convenience tool whose
value is for ACP-agent parity / human use rather than organic LLM adoption.

**An exploration tool's adoption rate is a property of the task, not just
the tool.** A "Go to Test"/"Create Test" navigation tool (locate a module's
test file and report which functions are still untested) was added to the
exploration-adjacent category, the same category as `view-structure` and
`show-diff` from the section above. On a task whose prompt already named the
untested functions ("test_calc.py only has a test for add, add tests for
subtract and multiply too"), adoption was 0, because the prompt had already
done the tool's job: there was nothing left to discover. On a second fixture
whose prompt left that gap for the agent to find ("add tests for any
function in inventory.py that doesn't already have a test"), the same tool
was adopted on both runs, and pulled a previously-inconsistent
`generate-test-stub` step along with it. Before concluding that an
exploration tool has low adoption, check whether the task prompt already
states the information the tool would surface; if it does, 0 adoption is the
correct outcome, not a sign the tool is unused.

### A/B testing a `toolkits` dimension with `--matrix`

When a `--matrix` varies `dimensions.toolkits` (e.g. `[[], ["./toolkits/my-tools"]]`)
but `base.system_prompt` is shared across both arms, the no-toolkit arm's
agent is still *told about* tools it doesn't have. It will try to call them
anyway, hit `command not found` (exit 127), then fall back to manual
`readFile`/`writeFile`/`executeCommand`. This adds at least one wasted
step/reasoning turn to the baseline - the toolkit arm's measured cost and
step-count advantage is therefore partly "has the tool" vs. "was told about
a tool it doesn't have", not purely "has the tool" vs. "never heard of it".

Mitigate the wasted-step part (without a full per-dimension system prompt,
which `--matrix` doesn't support) by adding a short fallback note after the
tool list in `base.system_prompt`:

```
Note: in some sandboxes the tools above are not installed. If running one
of them fails with "command not found", don't retry it - immediately fall
back to `executeCommand`/`readFile`/`writeFile` to do that step manually
and continue with the rest of the workflow below.
```

This lets the no-toolkit arm recognize `exit 127` and move straight to a
manual edit instead of spending a turn re-deciding to do so, tightening the
A/B comparison toward "has the tool" vs. "doesn't have it" rather than
"doesn't have it and is confused about why".

### Toolkit setup hooks (`setup.sh`)

A persistent `run-tests`-MISSING result (consistent since the metric was
introduced) turned out not to be a prompt or adoption problem at all: the
fixtures used a bare `python:3.11` image, which doesn't ship `pytest`. Both
the toolkit's `run-tests` wrapper *and* the agent's own first-choice
`python -m pytest` failed identically with `No module named pytest` - the
agent then abandoned pytest entirely and fell back to ad-hoc `python -c`
assertions, which still let the task pass but meant no test runner (custom
or standard) was ever successfully invoked.

A toolkit can now ship a `setup.sh` at its root, executed once when the
toolkit is injected into the sandbox (before the agent's prompt turn
starts) - see [ACP Agent Adapter](/advanced/acp-agent#using-toolkits-with-acp-agents).
`toolkits/jetbrains-tools/setup.sh` runs `pip install -q pytest` if missing.
After this fix, the agent's own `python -m pytest test_x.py` succeeded on
the first try - fewer steps, lower cost, no failed-command detour.

`run-tests` itself was also given a defense-in-depth self-install (the same
`pip install pytest`-if-missing check), so it works correctly even without
the toolkit's `setup.sh` having run.

Note this did **not** flip `run-tests` from MISSING to adopted: once
`python -m pytest <file>` works, it satisfies the agent's verification need
on these small, single-test-file fixtures just as well as `run-tests` would
- the same "redundant tool" dynamic as above, except the competing tool here
is a standard command agentgrader can't extend with a verdict line. Treat
`run-tests` adoption as most useful as a signal on larger repos with many
test files, where finding *which* test file to run has real value over a
blind `pytest`.

## CI recommendations

- Install with `npm install -g agentgrader` or `bun add -g agentgrader` on the runner.
- Validate all cases with `--strict` before benchmarking.
- Store API keys in encrypted CI secrets, not in the repo.
- Cap parallelism with `--concurrency` to match runner CPU and Docker limits.
- Gate expensive suites behind labels or scheduled workflows.

Full GitHub Actions example: [CI Integration](/advanced/ci-integration).

## Docker checklist

- Docker daemon must be running locally and on CI runners.
- Pull base images ahead of large benches to avoid cold-start timeouts.
- Increase `timeout_seconds` for tasks that compile heavy dependencies on first run.

### Validate a SWE-bench fixture's `success:` command before trusting FAIL

A `FAIL` on a SWE-bench style task can mean the agent's patch is wrong, or it can
mean the fixture's own `success:` command never passes even on the *unmodified*
fixture (a broken dependency pin, an unpinned transitive build dependency, a
flaky registry timeout). Before treating repeated `FAIL` results on a given
fixture as an agent-quality signal, run the `success:` command once against the
unmodified fixture (e.g. in a throwaway Docker container) to confirm it can pass
at all. A common culprit for Python fixtures: `pip install -e ".[test]"` without
`--no-build-isolation` builds in an isolated venv populated from
`pyproject.toml`'s `[build-system] requires`, so a version pin applied only to
the outer `pip install` (e.g. `pip install "setuptools<60"`) does not protect the
isolated build env, which can resolve a newer, incompatible build tool. If the
`success:` command fails this way, fix it once (e.g. add the same pin to
`[build-system] requires`) and re-validate before spending bench budget on that
fixture again.
