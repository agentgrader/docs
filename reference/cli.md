# CLI Reference

The `agr` command ships with the [`agentgrader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agentgrader) npm package.

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install -g agentgrader
agr <command>
```

```bash [bun]
bun add -g agentgrader
agr <command>
```

```bash [bunx / npx]
bunx agentgrader <command>
```

:::

> **Output convention**: `agr` output never contains emoji or other pictographic symbols, anywhere. Status is conveyed with plain text labels (`PASS`/`FAIL`, `[OK]`/`[WARN]`/`[FAIL]`, `[error]`) and, where the terminal supports it, ANSI/Ink color (green for pass, red for fail, yellow for warnings/in-progress, cyan for headers, gray for secondary text).

## `agr init`

Scaffold a minimal, runnable agentgrader project in the current directory (or `[dir]`), so you can try `agr run` immediately without writing any YAML by hand.

```bash
agr init
# or into a new directory:
agr init my-project
```

This creates:

- `agent.yaml`: a baseline agent config using `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` with `provider: anthropic` and `max_steps: 15`.
- `tasks/hello-world/agr.yaml` and `tasks/hello-world/fixture/`: a tiny, self-contained test case. The fixture is a `math.js` with an unimplemented `add(a, b)` and a `math.test.js` using Node's built-in test runner (`node --test`), so no `npm install` or `pip install` is needed inside the sandbox.

After scaffolding, set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your environment and run:

```bash
agr run hello-world --verbose
```

Use `--blank` if you'd rather start from an empty project and write your own test cases under `tasks/`:

```bash
agr init --blank
```

This writes only `agent.yaml` and an empty `tasks/` directory, skipping the `hello-world` sample. See [Core Concepts](/guide/concepts) for the `agr.yaml` schema, then run `agr list-tests` to confirm your test cases are found.

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `[dir]` | `.` | Directory to scaffold into. Created if it does not exist. |
| `--force` | `false` | Overwrite `agent.yaml` if it already exists. Without it, `agr init` refuses to run on a directory that already has an `agent.yaml`, similar to `git init` on an existing repo. |
| `--blank` | `false` | Only write `agent.yaml` and an empty `tasks/` directory, without the `hello-world` sample test case. |

### Examples

```bash
# Scaffold into the current directory
agr init

# Scaffold into a new directory
agr init my-project

# Re-scaffold, overwriting agent.yaml
agr init my-project --force

# Blank project: agent.yaml + empty tasks/, no sample test case
agr init --blank
```

## `agr list-tests`

Recursively scan a directory for test case files (`agr.yaml` and similar) and print each one's `name`, relative path, and description. Useful for discovering what `agr run`/`agr bench` accept as a short name instead of a full path.

```bash
agr list-tests
agr list-tests tasks/
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `[dir]` | `.` | Directory to scan recursively for test case YAML files. |
| `--json` | `false` | Print results as a JSON array (`name`, `path`, `relativePath`, optional `description`) instead of a human-readable table. Useful for scripting or CI step that enumerates test cases. |

### Examples

```bash
# List test cases under the current directory
agr list-tests

# List test cases under a specific directory
agr list-tests tasks/

# Machine-readable JSON (for scripting)
agr list-tests --json | jq '.[].name'
```

## `agr run`

Run a single test case with one agent config. Useful for debugging a specific case or iterating on prompts.

```bash
agr run hello-world --config agent.yaml
```

`<testCase>` accepts any of:

- a path to an `agr.yaml` file (with or without the `.yaml`/`.yml` extension)
- a path to a directory containing an `agr.yaml`
- a test case's `name:` field, or its directory's basename, looked up by recursively searching the current directory (as `agr list-tests` would find it)

`agr run` renders a live terminal UI (built with Ink) while the agent works, then a summary panel and diff once it finishes:

- **Live steps**: each `StepEvent` the agent emits appears as soon as it happens, color-coded by kind (tool calls, tool results, messages, thinking). With `--verbose`, each step shows its tool name and a truncated content preview (up to 200 characters). Without `--verbose`, you instead get a compact running counter of step count and accumulated cost.
- **Summary panel**: a bordered `RUN SUMMARY` box showing status (`PASSED`/`FAILED`), step count, cost, duration, the prompt-cache hit rate (`prompt cache: X/Y input tokens served from cache (Z%)`), any run error, and the regression/diff/localization metric lines (skipped checks are flagged with `[skip]`).
- **Diff**: if the agent changed any files, a `Diff` panel renders the unified git diff with added lines in green, removed lines in red, and hunk headers (`@@ ...`) in cyan. Large diffs are capped at 60 lines with a "... N more line(s)" note.

Exit codes: `0` once the run completes by default, even when the agent scores `FAILED`. Use `--fail-on-failure` to exit `1` on a failed run (required for CI gates). Exit `1` also when the run itself throws (e.g. a sandbox or provider error).

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `<testCase>` | Required | Path to an `agr.yaml` file, a directory containing one, or a test case name/directory basename (see above). |
| `--config <path>` | Required if not in agr.yaml | Path to an agent config YAML. Required when the test case's `agr.yaml` does not specify `agent_config:`. |
| `--adapter <name>` | `ai-sdk` | Agent adapter: `ai-sdk` (default AI SDK loop) or `acp` (external ACP agent). See [ACP Agent Adapter](/advanced/acp-agent). |
| `--verbose` | `false` | Show full per-step detail (tool name + content preview) in the live step list, instead of the compact step/cost counter. |
| `--fail-on-failure` | `false` | Exit with code 1 if the run does not pass. |
| `--report <format>` | (none) | Write a report after the run (`json`, `jsonl`, `html`, `md`). |
| `--output <path>` | (none) | Output path for `--report`. |
| `--report-include-traces` | `false` | Include full step traces in `--report` output. |
| `--sandbox <provider>` | `docker` | Sandbox provider: `docker` (local Docker) or `e2b` (E2B cloud). See [Custom Sandbox](/advanced/custom-sandbox). |
| `--llm-judge` | `false` | Run `LlmJudgeScorer` after the agent completes. |
| `--llm-judge-provider <name>` | `anthropic` | LLM judge provider: `anthropic` or `openai`. |
| `--llm-judge-model <model>` | (provider default) | Model slug for the LLM judge. |
| `--judge-gate` | `false` | Fail the run when the LLM judge score is below `--judge-min-score`. |
| `--judge-min-score <score>` | `0.7` | Minimum normalized judge score when `--judge-gate` is set. |

### Examples

```bash
# Name-based lookup (resolves tasks/fix-greeting/agr.yaml automatically)
agr run fix-greeting --config agent.yaml

# Watch tool calls and messages in real time
agr run fix-greeting --config agent.yaml --verbose

# External ACP agent (Claude Code, Cursor Agent, ...)
agr run fix-greeting --config agent-acp.yaml --adapter acp

# CI gate: fail the job when the agent does not pass
agr run fix-greeting --config agent.yaml --fail-on-failure

# LLM judge with a pass/fail gate
agr run fix-greeting --config agent.yaml --llm-judge --judge-gate --judge-min-score 0.75
```

## `agr bench`

Run test cases against one or more agent configs (or an optimizer matrix). Shows a live terminal dashboard and runs evaluations in parallel.

`<testCases>` accepts the same forms as [`agr run`](#agr-run): a path to an `agr.yaml` file, a directory containing one, or a test case name/directory basename resolved by searching the current directory. When positional names are given without `--suite`, each is resolved individually. When `--suite` is given alongside positional names, the suite is loaded and then filtered to the named subset.

```bash
agr bench hello-world --matrix matrix.yaml
agr bench task-a task-b --configs agent.yaml
agr bench --suite tasks/ --configs agent.yaml,agent-alt.yaml --concurrency 2
agr bench --suite tasks/ --configs-dir agents-configs/
agr bench --manifest bench.yaml
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `[...testCases]` | (all in suite) | One or more test case names, directories, or `agr.yaml` paths to run. When given without `--suite`, each is resolved via name search (see above). |
| `--manifest <path>` | (none) | Bench manifest YAML with `suite` and `agents` (paths/glob). Replaces `--suite` + `--configs` on the CLI. |
| `--suite <path>` | Required without positional args or `--manifest` | Directory containing test case folders (each with an `agr.yaml`). |
| `--configs <paths>` | One agent source required | Comma-separated paths to agent config YAML files. |
| `--config <path>` | (none) | Alias for `--configs` when you have a single agent config file. |
| `--configs-dir <dir>` | (none) | Load every `.yaml`/`.yml` file in the directory as an agent config. |
| `--matrix <path>` | (none) | Optimizer matrix YAML. Expands into the cartesian product of agent configs, tags runs with a shared `matrixId`, and prints a Pareto summary. See [Core Concepts: Optimizer matrices](/guide/concepts#optimizer-matrices). |
| `--adapters <names>` | `ai-sdk` | Comma-separated adapter names (`ai-sdk`, `acp`). Runs the full config matrix once per adapter. |
| `--concurrency <n>` | `2` | Number of parallel sandbox executions. Overrides manifest `concurrency` when set. |
| `--fail-on-failure` | `false` | Exit with code 1 if any run in the benchmark fails. |
| `--min-solve-rate <rate>` | (none) | Exit with code 1 if solve rate is below this threshold (0–1). |
| `--min-solve-rate-scope <scope>` | `global` | Apply `--min-solve-rate` globally or per agent config (`global`, `per-config`). |
| `--report <format>` | (none) | Write a report after the bench (`json`, `jsonl`, `html`, `md`). |
| `--output <path>` | (none) | Output path for `--report`. |
| `--report-include-traces` | `false` | Include full step traces in `--report` output. |
| `--save-baseline <path>` | (none) | Write a baseline snapshot JSON after the bench completes. |
| `--sandbox <provider>` | `docker` | Sandbox provider: `docker` or `e2b`. |
| `--strict-toolkits` | `false` | Exit with code 1 if any referenced toolkit fails the security audit. |
| `--llm-judge` | `false` | Run `LlmJudgeScorer` on each completed run. |
| `--llm-judge-provider <name>` | `anthropic` | LLM judge provider: `anthropic` or `openai`. |
| `--llm-judge-model <model>` | (provider default) | Model slug for the LLM judge. |
| `--judge-gate` | `false` | Fail runs when the LLM judge score is below `--judge-min-score`. |
| `--judge-min-score <score>` | `0.7` | Minimum normalized judge score when `--judge-gate` is set. |
| `--dry-run` | `false` | Print the resolved test case x config matrix and exit without starting any runs. |

Use only **one** agent source per run: `--manifest`, `--configs`/`--config`, `--configs-dir`, or `--matrix`.

Exit codes: `0` by default after a completed bench. Use `--fail-on-failure`, `--min-solve-rate`, and/or `--strict-toolkits` for CI gates. See [CI Integration](/advanced/ci-integration).

### Examples

```bash
# Run a single named test case with a matrix (no --suite needed)
agr bench hello-world --matrix matrix.yaml

# Run two named test cases against a specific agent config
agr bench task-a task-b --configs agent.yaml

# Filter a suite to one test case
agr bench hello-world --suite tasks/ --configs agent.yaml

# Bench manifest (suite + agent glob in one file)
agr bench --manifest bench.yaml

# All agent YAMLs in a folder
agr bench --suite tasks/ --configs-dir agents-configs/

# Single agent config (--config is an alias for --configs)
agr bench --suite tasks/ --config agent.yaml

# Multiple agent configs
agr bench --suite tasks/ --configs agent.yaml,agent-openrouter.yaml

# ACP agent adapter
agr bench --suite tasks/ --configs agent-acp.yaml --adapters acp

# Compare AI SDK loop vs ACP agent
agr bench --suite tasks/ --configs agent.yaml,agent-acp.yaml --adapters ai-sdk,acp

# Optimizer matrix sweep
agr bench --suite tasks/ --matrix matrix.yaml

# Higher parallelism
agr bench --manifest bench.yaml --concurrency 4

# CI gate with report artifact
agr bench --suite tasks/ --config agent.yaml \
  --fail-on-failure --min-solve-rate 0.8 \
  --report json --output reports/bench.json

# Save baseline snapshot for PR comparison
agr bench --suite tasks/ --config agent.yaml --save-baseline baselines/main.json

# Preview what would run (no sandbox, no API calls)
agr bench --suite tasks/ --matrix matrix.yaml --dry-run
```

See [Bench Manifest YAML](/reference/bench-manifest-yaml) for the manifest file format.

Every bench run is also scored by `StaticQualityScorer` (diff size, lint violations, etc.). See [Quality scorers](/guide/concepts#quality-scorers-and-the-optimizer).

After the dashboard finishes, `agr bench` also prints a **TOOL USAGE BY CONFIG** block: per agent config, aggregated counts of each `tool_call` name across all runs in that bench session. Use this to compare toolkit adoption between configs (for example default tools vs. a custom `toolkits` matrix dimension) without calling `agr trace <runId> --tools` on every cell. Per-run detail remains available via `agr trace --tools`.

## `agr validate`

Validate one or more test cases the way SWE-bench validates a candidate instance: static checks, then (when `test_command` is set) pre-patch and post-patch execution inside Docker.

```bash
agr validate fix-greeting
agr validate task-a task-b task-c --strict
```

Each `<testCase>` accepts the same forms as [`agr run`](#agr-run): a path to an `agr.yaml` file, a directory containing one, or a test case name/directory basename resolved by searching the current directory.

When `test_command` is missing, execution checks are skipped (shown with ⚠️). Use `--strict` in CI to require `test_command`, `fail_to_pass`, and `pass_to_pass`.

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `[...testCases]` | Required (at least one) | One or more paths, directories, or test case names. When multiple are given, each is validated in turn; exits 1 if any fail. |
| `--strict` | `false` | Exit with code 1 if `test_command`, `fail_to_pass`, or `pass_to_pass` are missing. |
| `--sandbox <provider>` | `docker` | Sandbox provider used for execution checks: `docker` or `e2b`. |
| `--audit-toolkits` | `false` | Run the toolkit security audit on every `toolkits:` path referenced by the test case. |

### Examples

```bash
# Static + execution checks (when test_command is configured)
agr validate my-case

# CI gate: reject incomplete definitions
agr validate my-case --strict

# Validate every test case in a directory at once
agr validate task-a task-b task-c --strict
```

## `agr import-pr`

Fetch a GitHub pull request diff, split it into solution and test patches, and scaffold a new test case with `expected_files` and `forbid_modified` pre-filled.

```bash
agr import-pr owner/repo 123 --out tasks/new-case --clone-fixture
```

With `--clone-fixture`, the repo is checked out at the PR's base commit into `<out>/fixture`, and `success`/`test_command` are guessed from the project layout (Python, Node, Go). You still need to fill in `fail_to_pass` and `pass_to_pass` manually before `agr validate` can verify execution.

Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to avoid GitHub's low unauthenticated rate limits.

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `<repo>` | Required | GitHub repository in `owner/repo` format. |
| `<prNumber>` | Required | Pull request number. |
| `--out <dir>` | `./imported/<repo>-pr-<n>` | Output directory for the scaffolded test case. |
| `--clone-fixture` | `false` | Clone the repo at the PR's base commit into `<out>/fixture`. |
| `--validate` | `false` | Run `agr validate` after scaffolding. Most useful after filling in test name lists. |

### Examples

```bash
# Scaffold patches and agr.yaml only
agr import-pr astropy/astropy 12907 --out tasks/astropy-12907

# Clone fixture and guess test commands
agr import-pr astropy/astropy 12907 --clone-fixture --out tasks/astropy-12907

# Scaffold and validate (after filling in fail_to_pass/pass_to_pass)
agr import-pr astropy/astropy 12907 --clone-fixture --validate
```

## `agr trace`

Print the step trace and metrics for a single run, looked up by run ID (shown in bench/run output and stored in `.agr/db.sqlite`).

```bash
agr trace 3f1c2e2a-8b4d-4e1f-9c3a-1a2b3c4d5e6f
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `<runId>` | Required | UUID of the run to inspect. |
| `--quality` | `false` | Show only the quality-metrics breakdown (`static-quality`, `llm-judge`, diff, localization) instead of the full step trace. |
| `--tools` | `false` | Show only a tool-usage breakdown: how many times each tool name appears across the run's `tool_call` steps, sorted by call count. |

### Examples

```bash
# Full step-by-step trace
agr trace 3f1c2e2a-8b4d-4e1f-9c3a-1a2b3c4d5e6f

# Quality metrics only
agr trace 3f1c2e2a-8b4d-4e1f-9c3a-1a2b3c4d5e6f --quality

# Tool-usage breakdown (which tools the agent actually called, and how often)
agr trace 3f1c2e2a-8b4d-4e1f-9c3a-1a2b3c4d5e6f --tools
```

`--tools` is especially useful for checking whether a custom toolkit, MCP server, or Agent Skill was actually used by the agent versus only made available to it. For example, if you wire in a custom toolkit but its tools show a count of `0`, the agent saw the tool but chose not to call it, which may be a sign the system prompt needs to nudge it more explicitly.

## `agr list`

Browse saved runs from `.agr/db.sqlite` in an interactive terminal UI: a scrollable run list, a detail view (run metadata, agent diff, trace preview), and a side-by-side diff compare between any two runs.

```bash
agr list
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--db <path>` | `.agr/db.sqlite` | Path to the SQLite database to read. |
| `--limit <n>` | `100` | Maximum number of most-recent runs to load. |
| `--plain` | `false` | Print a plain text list instead of the interactive UI. Used automatically when stdout is not a TTY. |

### Examples

```bash
# Open the interactive run browser
agr list

# Print a plain text summary of the 20 most recent runs
agr list --limit 20 --plain
```

In the interactive UI, use the arrow keys (or `j`/`k`) to move through the run list, `Enter` to open a run's detail view (agent diff plus a trace preview), `c` to start a diff comparison between two runs, `b`/`Esc` to go back, and `q` to quit.

## `agr compare`

Compare the step traces of two completed runs side by side. Useful after a matrix or bench run with multiple agent configs on the same test case: see when and where the agents diverged (different tool calls, files, or reasoning).

```bash
agr compare 3f1c2e2a-8b4d-4e1f-9c3a-1a2b3c4d5e6f 7a8b9c0d-1e2f-3a4b-5c6d-7e8f9a0b1c2d
```

Run IDs come from bench/run output or the `runs` table in `.agr/db.sqlite`. Both runs should usually share the same `test_case_id` so step indices align.

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `<runIdA>` | Required | First run to compare (shown as column A). |
| `<runIdB>` | Required | Second run to compare (shown as column B). |
| `--full` | `false` | Print full step content without the 200-character truncation used by `agr trace`. |
| `--only-diff` | `false` | Show only divergent steps, plus one step of context before and after each divergence. |

### Examples

```bash
# Full side-by-side comparison
agr compare <runIdA> <runIdB>

# Only where the runs diverged (with 1-step context)
agr compare <runIdA> <runIdB> --only-diff

# Full content for divergent steps
agr compare <runIdA> <runIdB> --only-diff --full
```

## `agr compare-baseline`

Compare two baseline snapshot JSON files, or compare the most recent runs in `.agr/db.sqlite` against a saved baseline. Useful for PR comments and regression gates. See [CI Integration: Baseline comparison](/advanced/ci-integration#baseline-comparison-in-pull-requests).

```bash
agr compare-baseline baselines/main.json baselines/pr.json
agr compare-baseline --current baselines/main.json --format md --output comment.md
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `[snapshotA]` | (none) | Path to the baseline snapshot (older/reference). |
| `[snapshotB]` | (none) | Path to the current snapshot (newer/candidate). |
| `--current <path>` | (none) | Compare recent runs in the SQLite DB against this baseline snapshot instead of two files. |
| `--format <format>` | `md` | Output format: `md` (PR comment markdown) or `json`. |
| `--output <path>` | (none) | Write comparison to a file instead of stdout. |
| `--db <path>` | `.agr/db.sqlite` | SQLite database for `--current`. |
| `--fail-on-regression` | `false` | Exit with code 1 if solve rate dropped or any previously passing case regressed. |

### Examples

```bash
# Side-by-side snapshot diff on stdout
agr compare-baseline baselines/main.json baselines/pr-42.json

# PR comment markdown from the latest bench run in the DB
agr compare-baseline --current baselines/main.json --format md --output comment.md

# Fail CI when regressions are detected
agr compare-baseline --current baselines/main.json --fail-on-regression
```

Pair with `agr bench --save-baseline <path>` to produce snapshot files.

## `agr validate-toolkit`

Run the toolkit security audit on a toolkit directory (`bin/` scripts and `.claude/skills/`). Reports risky patterns (network calls, shell escapes, missing skill docs).

```bash
agr validate-toolkit ./toolkits/jetbrains-tools
agr validate-toolkit ./toolkits/jetbrains-tools --strict
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `<dir>` | Required | Path to the toolkit directory. |
| `--strict` | `false` | Exit with code 1 on warnings as well as errors. |

`agr bench --strict-toolkits` and `agr validate --audit-toolkits` use the same audit logic across referenced toolkits.

## `agr export`

Export run metadata or step traces from `.agr/db.sqlite` for downstream analytics or observability pipelines.

```bash
agr export runs --format jsonl --output runs.jsonl
agr export traces --run-id <runId> --format otlp --output trace.json
```

### Subcommands

| Subcommand | Description |
|---|---|
| `runs` | Export run rows (optionally filtered by `--matrix-id`). |
| `traces` | Export step traces for a single run (`--run-id` required). |

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--format <format>` | `json` | Export format: `json`, `jsonl`, or `otlp` (traces only). |
| `--output <path>` | auto-named | Output file path. |
| `--db <path>` | `.agr/db.sqlite` | SQLite database to read. |
| `--run-id <id>` | (none) | Run UUID (required for `export traces`). |
| `--matrix-id <id>` | (none) | Filter `export runs` to a bench matrix id. |
| `--limit <n>` | (none) | Maximum number of runs to export. |

Set `AGR_EXPORT_ON_BENCH=true` to auto-export run JSON after each `agr bench` completes (written under `.agr/exports/`).

## `agr cleanup`

Lists (or, with `--yes`, removes) leftover sandbox containers from runs whose process exited or was killed before the `cleanup` workflow step could call `destroy()` - for example a hung provider request that an external `timeout` had to kill. These show up as containers running `tail -f /dev/null`, labeled `agentgrader.sandbox=true` by `DockerSandboxProvider`.

```bash
agr cleanup
agr cleanup --yes
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--yes` | `false` | Actually remove the listed containers. Without it, `agr cleanup` only lists what would be removed. |

Set `step_timeout_ms` in `agent.yaml` (see [Agent Config: `step_timeout_ms`](/reference/agent-config-yaml#step-timeout-ms)) to prevent new leftovers in the first place - `agr cleanup` is for sweeping up containers from runs that predate that fix, or from any other interrupted run.

Containers created before this label was added (older `@agentgrader/sandbox-docker` versions) won't be found by `agr cleanup`; remove those manually with `docker ps -a` / `docker rm -f`.
